                    <h2>My Gymnastics Journey</h2>
                    <p>I started rhythmic gymnastics when I was just 4 years old. My mom took me to watch a gymnastics show, and I told her, "I want to do that!" The very next week, I began my first class.</p>
                    <p>At first, I was a little scared of the big gymnasium, but my coach, Ms. Fatma, was so nice and helped me learn all the basic moves. I practiced hard and soon I could do splits and cartwheels!</p>
                    <p>When I turned 6, I entered my first competition. I was nervous, but when I stepped onto the carpet, I forgot all about being scared. I won a gold medal that day!</p>
                    <p>Now I train 5 days a week. I love all the apparatus – ribbon, ball, hoop, and clubs – but ribbon is my absolute favorite because it makes such pretty patterns in the air.</p>
                    <p>So far, I’ve won <strong>two gold medals</strong> in air championships, <strong>one silver medal</strong> in a professional competition, and <strong>one bronze medal</strong> in another professional event. I'm so proud and excited for more!</p>
